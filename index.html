            28th Amendment
        </h1>
        <p>
            We should change the 26th amendment, the natioal voting age is being lowered down from 18 to 15 years old. Because the 26'th amendment is making a tyranny to the younger generation. Allowing 15 years old to vote in the country would let them have a voice and be inolve in politic.

                    15-17 years old are working jobs and paying federal taxes but not alowing to vote in any sort of election. Basicially the same thing as not having any sort of representative in the government, and that would be the same thing as the famous quote "No Taxation Without representative".

                    Overall the age of voting should be lowered. If you are working and paying any sort of federal taxes you should be able to vote, for helping the younger generation of people being heard throughtout the nation. Then letting them have any sort of representative in the nation and people would fight for that.
